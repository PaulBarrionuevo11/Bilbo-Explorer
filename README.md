# Introduction
Bilbo is the aspiration of drones flying the airspace of the planet Earth and maybe one day Mars. With the combination of a strong design, computer architecture and the understanding of the laws of physics, Bilbo tries to motivate an ambitious project that can be share with others.

# Project Overview
The Idea is to work with relative out of the shelf components and create a basic Drone model that can be replicated. 
The Goal is to launch the first demo using a prototype in order to validate: design, aerodynamics and power systems. Documentation will be posted on the website http://paulstein.site
and the proper adjustemnts done on this README file

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
* Access to Internet
* Access to Ethernet (recommended)
* A microcontroller: ESP32 or Arduino family. 
* The project its been worked on Windows and MACOS.
* For the microcomputer, I'll be using a Jetson Nano (Possibility of adding changes to be used with Raspberry Pi)

## Installation
* Your desired IDE (recommend Visual Studio) to work on your server
* Arduino IDE or PlatformIO for the microcontroller
* Jetson Nano Developer Kit SD Card Image: https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-devkit#write
* Using Rpanion: https://www.docs.rpanion.com/software/rpanion-server (page to download the server image)
* Download the code from this repo

## Hardware
## Components
The electonic components used in this project are (as of now) the following:
