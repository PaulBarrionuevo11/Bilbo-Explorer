# Introduction
Bilbo is the aspiration of drones flying the airspace of planets like Mars. With the combination of a strong design, computer architecture and the understanding of the laws of physics, Bilbo tries to motivate an ambitious project that can be share with others.

# Project Overview
The idea is to work with relative out of the shelf components and create a basic model that can be replicated. The main goal is to launch a first demo and to properly document the steps followed in this README file as well as on the website http://paulstein.site
