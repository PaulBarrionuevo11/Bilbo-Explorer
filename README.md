# Introduction
Bilbo is the aspiration of drones flying the airspace of the planet Earth and maybe one day Mars. With the combination of a strong design, computer architecture and the understanding of the laws of physics, Bilbo tries to motivate an ambitious project that can be share with others.

# Project Overview
The Idea is to work with relative out of the shelf components and create a basic Drone model that can be replicated. 
The Goal is to launch the first demo using a prototype in order to validate: design, aerodynamics and power systems. Documentation will be posted on the website http://paulstein.site
and the proper adjustemnts done on this README file

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
* Access to Internet
* Access to Ethernet (recommended)
* Access to a microcontroller or the ESP32 or Arduino family. 
* The project its been worked on Windows or MACOS but if you use a Linux computer and you can run your IDE and upload the code into your microcontroller, it should be ok.
* For the microcomputer, I'll be using a Jetson Nano (Possibility of adding changes to be used with Raspberry Pi)
